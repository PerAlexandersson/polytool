# Handoff

Full chronology through the start of the current repository-health batch is in
[`docs/HANDOFF_ARCHIVE_THROUGH_2026-09-16.md`](docs/HANDOFF_ARCHIVE_THROUGH_2026-09-16.md).

## Active: repository health remediation — 2026-09-16

The host supervisor owns final integration, CI observation, documentation,
suggestions, and this handoff. All bounded source workers have completed and
released their files; there is no active source ownership in this repository.
Commits `4a897bf`, `e777c57`, and `f7d136f` are pushed on `master`.

The final performance follow-up streams Combpoly permutation statistics,
flagged-tableau weights, QSym quasi-shuffle multiplicities, and both general
and chordal graph sink-polynomial independent sets. Noncrossing and nonnesting
matchings now prune invalid branches directly. Full affected-package tests pass:
266 combinatoric-core, 194 Combpoly library plus 2 binary, 204 multipoly, and
136 QSym tests, together with all affected examples.

The 961 ignored experiment binaries remain local and untracked. Broad builds
must not compete with the active eight-process KTT computation; focused checks
use external targets, reduced priority, and separate CPU affinity when safe.

The root workspace now excludes the standalone `experiments` and retired
`KTT-search` workspaces, each with a committed lockfile. The Combpoly inner Git
metadata was preserved as a verified bundle and recoverable metadata directory
under `/mnt/2TB-Babel/ai-storage/source/repo-metadata-backups/` before removal
from the working tree. The nested Kostka metadata-only checkpoint is
`a4f01fe`, pushed to `origin/main`.

The remaining deliberate debt is narrow: add durable performance benchmarks,
resolve the 38 pre-existing strict-Clippy findings in combinatoric-core, and
upgrade the isolated experiments/KTT MySQL chain when its upstream
future-incompatibility warning is resolved. See
[`suggestions/rust-repository-health-2026-09-16.md`](suggestions/rust-repository-health-2026-09-16.md).

## Durable policy

- `master` is the canonical monorepo branch; `polytool/main` is generated only
  by `scripts/sync-polytool-main.sh` after its prerequisites pass.
- Use root Cargo commands for maintained crates and explicit `--manifest-path`
  commands for experiments or legacy KTT.
- Keep ignored experiments disposable. Promote only stable reusable kernels
  into documented and tested library APIs.
- Keep build output in `/cargo-target/ai-projects`, not this source tree.
- Preserve unrelated worker changes and record new ownership here before
  adopting a dirty file.
